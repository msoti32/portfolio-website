    <h1>About Marko Sotirovic</h1>
    <p>I’m a UX/UI Designer who graduated from the Illinois Institute of Art with a Bachelor’s in Graphic Design. I came primarily from a print background and shortly after starting my first print-focused design role, I recognized early on that the future was in web and application design. I was a bit frustrated with my lack of education in this new realm and realized if I was going to ever make it, I had to do it on my own and going back to school wasn’t an option. So needless to say, after about 8 months in my first position I took a gamble amidst the economy crash and dove straight into the (very) deep end of web development and began a primarily self-taught adventure.</p>

<p>Taking a chance on myself proved to me and forever ingrained in me that you can do anything you set your mind to.</p>

<p>After learning how to swim in the world of front-end development and a short but highly educational period in the agency world, I knew it was time to go freelance full-time. During this time, I got to work on every medium imaginable and for some pretty amazing clients. I faced deadlines and challenges that really helped me grow as a designer and thinker. The word “No” didn’t exit my lips and I accepted any task that came my way.</p>
